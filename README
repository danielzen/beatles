John, Paul, George and Ringo are planning to go on a magical mystery tour in their yellow submarine.
In order for all their friends to be aboard they need a system to find out where to find them.

The attached json file includes their guests, who invited them and their pickup locations.

Build a system that lets you query the guests of each Beatle; We need to know:

* How many guests each Beatle invited
* A leaderboard of the most liked albums
* How many people are being picked up from each location.

You do not need to build a graphical UI or use a database, but you should architect the code to
potentially support such an addition in the future. You should build an OOP system which makes use of
Models and Controllers. Feel free to do this in Typescript or PHP.
